# Introduction:

In this project I will be building an eCommerce platform from scratch. The e-shop I will build will include the following features:

* Full-featured shopping cart with quantity
* Product reviews and ratings
* Top products carousel
* Product pagination
* Product search feature
* User profile with orders
* Admin product management
* Admin user management
* Admin Order details page
* Mark orders as delivered option
* Checkout process (shipping, payment method, etc)
* PayPal / credit card integration
* Custom database seeder script

This eShop was developed in a linear and progressive way, using React, Redux, Node, Express & MongoDB, JWT authentication in an HTTP-only cookie, a fully featured shopping cart with PayPal & credit/debit payments, an administration area to manage customers, products & orders, a complete product rating & review system and a product search, carousel and pagination. The following development techniques and tools are used in the project:
