The eShop is developed by using: <br>
React, Redux, Node, Express & MongoDB, JWT authentication in an HTTP-only cookie, a fully featured shopping cart with PayPal & credit/debit payments, an administration area to manage customers, products & orders, a complete product rating & review system and a product search, carousel and pagination.<br>
